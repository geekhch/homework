\section{Question1}
\textbf{Q:}The definition of manifold?\\
\par \textbf{A:}In mathematics, a manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. More precisely, each point of an n-dimensional manifold has a neighbourhood that is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space of dimension n. In this more precise terminology, a manifold is referred to as an n-manifold. 

\section{Question2}
\textbf{Q:}What means Locally, Linear and embedding?\\
\par \textbf{A:} Locally means for each data point $x_i$, finding its k nearest neighbors. Linear means compute the linear reconstruction coefficient $W_{ij}$. Embedding means using W as an invariance for DR by embedding it into the manifold.

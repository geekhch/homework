# Lab 2 - Feedforward Computation

## Information

* Course: Understanding Deep Neural Networks
* Teacher: Zhang Yi
* Student:
* ID:

## Files

* `main_c.m` - the MATLAB code file for XOR-worms example. Please fill it with component implement
* `fc_c.m` - the MATLAB code file for feedforward computation in component form
* `main_v.m` - the MATLAB code file for XOR-worms example. Please fill it with vector implement
* `fc_v.m` - the MATLAB code file for feedforward computation in vector form

## Instructions

### Task 1: Implement the forward computation of FNN in component form
1. in `fc_c.m`, add external inputs with value 1
2. in `fc_c.m`, calculate net input for each neuron
3. in `fc_c.m`, calculate activation for each neuron
4. in `main_c.m`, calculate the activation a2, call function fc_c
5. in `main_c.m`, calculate the activation a3, call function fc_c

### Task 2: Implement the forward computation of FNN in vector form
1. in `fc_v.m`, add external inputs with value 1
2. in `fc_v.m`, calculate net input for all neurons
3. in `fc_v.m`, calculate activation for each neurons
4. in `main_v.m`, calculate the activation a2, call function fc_v
5. in `main_v.m`, calculate the activation a3, call function fc_v
